							<h2>Climate Modeling in VR</h2>
							<p>
								This project was a fully immersive, VR-based data visualization tool for climate data that allows the user to 'experience' climate change.
								Based on a given year and estimated pollution emission levels, three key data factors
								(precipitation, temperature, and sea level rise) were taken from the World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal 
								through a custom-built deployed API to visualize the effects of climate change. I led the team of 4 developers and one designer, 
								pioneering our efforts on both full system and data integration, as well as UI elements. 
								Check out the demo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kUb31Hu4PMnKL6p_OOwfLaiJYdnZn_p/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

							<h2>Interactive storytelling in VR</h2>
							<p>
								Our goal was to create an immersive story experience, where the user is at the heart of the narrative. YOU
							    have to help a robot retrieve the core energy orb of its planet to save the planet. I worked on this project with two designers,
								and I was responsible for all scripting, integration, interaction and navigation.

							<h2>Floridian loggerhead ecosystem simulation in Unity</h2>
							<p>
								The goal of this project was to build an interactive simulation of Loggerhead populations based on various environmental factors.
								Upon user input, the simulation makes a request to a Python Flask REST API that I 
								built in order to compute factually accurate timescales and retrieve real nesting 
								data pertaining to the highest density Florida beaches for loggerhead nesting from 
								the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission REST API services. 
								Every beach simulates a real-life Florida beach, all key aspects of the sea turtle life 
								cycle are captured in code, and all times are computed to be proportional in timescale.

							<h2>NYC Historical Weather modeling in AR</h2>
							<p>
								This project aims to bring weather data to life using an interactive 3D model display of NYC. 
								Our goal with this project was to explore geographical space, combining real geographic and 
								weather data with the awesomeness of VFX/Unity effects. I built this with a partner, and was 
								responsible for data networking throughout our application from Weatherbit.io's 
								hourly weather data API, as well as the VFX effects and UI elements.

						<article class="thumb">
							<a href="images/ui.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/ui.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<h2>VR UI/UX</h2>
							<p>
								User centered design is incredibly important. Particularly with 3D space being such an uncharted frontier, 
								good UI and UX are integral to VR. I spent a lot of time this term reflecting on what that might mean, 
								talking to potential users of my projects and creating projects with user centered elements to them. This UI,
								built for VR Climate Modeling, was modified based off of Oculus Debug UI and designed in Figma.

									<h2>Hi, I'm Catherine</h2>
									<p>
										This is my portfolio of work built over the winter term of 2022 for DartmouthXR. 
										From simple Unity, to AR and VR, I am interested in building user-centered applications, 
										driven by data.
										<br /><br />
										As I'm interested in browser-based web development, I am currently working on optimizing projects 
										for WebQL deployment in the browser. Check back in soon for more! In the meantime...
